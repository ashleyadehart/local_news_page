## Semantic HTML Elements Used
- `<header>`: Displays the site name and tagline.
- `<nav>`: Contains navigation links for the website.
- `<main>`: Holds the primary content of the page.
- `<section>`: Groups related content such as “Top Stories” and “Upcoming Events.”
- `<article>`: Represents individual, self-contained news stories.
- `<footer>`: Contains copyright and supplemental site information.

Using semantic HTML improves accessibility, readability, and helps search engines better understand the content.

## CSS Styling Approach
- All styling is handled in a **separate CSS file** linked in the HTML `<head>`.
- CSS controls layout, spacing, colors, and typography.
- Separating HTML and CSS follows best practices and makes the project easier to maintain.
